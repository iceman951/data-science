#         • Sub function that support 2 values which are transferred from main function. Then, plus them, and return them to main function.
#         • Sub function that support 2 values which are transferred from main function. Then, minus them, and return them to main function.
#         • Sub function that support 2 values which are transferred from main function. Then, multiply them, and return them to main function.
#         • Sub function that support 2 values which are transferred from main function. Then, divide them, and return them to main function.
